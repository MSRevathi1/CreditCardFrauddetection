 Data set: Credit card fraud detection provided by UpGrad.


## Features

-Data Pre processing:-

       Includes data cleaning  feature scaling and dimensionallity reduction techniques to prepare the data for modelling. 

Machine Learning models:- 

        Utilizes various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression , Decision Trees , Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to detect fraudulent transactions.

Evaluation Matrix:- 

        Evaluates model performance using matrix like accuracy ,precision , recall, F1 score and ROC , AUC to asses the effectiveness of the fraud detection system. 

 Dateset :-

        Dataset used for training and testing the models contains transactions made by Credit Cards in September 2013 by European card holders. It presents transactions that occured in two days where we have 492 frauds out of 284807 transactions.
